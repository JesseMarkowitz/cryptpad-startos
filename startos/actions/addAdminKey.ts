/**
 * Extract and canonicalize a CryptPad public signing key, from either a
 * profile-link (`[name@host/keyValue=]`) or a bare key.
 *
 * # Semantics are copied from upstream, not invented
 *
 * Mirrors `Keys.canonicalize` / `parseNewUser` in
 * src/common/common-signing-keys.js@2026.5.1. Two rules matter:
 *
 *   1. **Length is fixed at 44 characters** (an Ed25519 public key: 32 bytes
 *      base64 = 43 chars + '='). Upstream's `canonicalize` accepts a bare key
 *      only when `input.length === 44`, and its profile-link parser only
 *      matches `/([a-zA-Z0-9+-]{43}=)$/`.
 *   2. **`-` is the escaped form of `/`.** Profile links escape `/` to `-` so
 *      the key survives being embedded in a URL-ish string; upstream's
 *      `unescape` maps it back. We store the unescaped (canonical) form, which
 *      is what CryptPad's own `Env.admins` holds and what the /admin/ panel
 *      shows.
 *
 * There is **no `_` in this alphabet.** A previous revision of this function
 * accepted base64url `_` on the theory that "keys in the wild use both" — that
 * is wrong; upstream never produces or accepts `_`.
 *
 * # Why the length check is load-bearing
 *
 * The previous version validated the character set but not the length, so any
 * alphanumeric string (e.g. `notarealkey`) was accepted and written into
 * config.js. CryptPad does not grant that entry any access — lib/env.js maps
 * config.adminKeys through `Keys.canonicalize` and `.filter(Boolean)`, so a
 * malformed key is dropped from `Env.admins` — but it is kept verbatim in
 * `Env.adminsData`, which is what the /admin/ panel renders. The visible
 * result is a junk row with a blank key that cannot be removed from the UI.
 * Worse, a user who merely typos a real key sees the action succeed while the
 * administrator silently has no access. Caught in v1 testing (checklist #10).
